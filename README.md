## Features
- ðŸš€ Extendable Plugin structure allowing you to tune calendars & enrich duty officers information with for example LDAP.
- ðŸ“ˆ Full <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5545.txt">RFC 5545</a> compliant iCalendar support, including recurring events, by using [iCal-library](https://jorricks.github.io/iCal-library/).

    3. Icons for extra user information.
    4. And much much more.
- ðŸ’ª React front-end is pre-compiled and served through FastAPI.
- ðŸ†Ž Fully typed code base.

## Requirements
Python 3.8+

DutyBoard runs using:
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as web service.
- [iCal-library](https://jorricks.github.io/iCal-library/) for it's integration with iCalendars.

## Plugin structure
More on this later once it's fully deployed.

## Why this project?
Larger corporations often have many Duty schedules. This is often to shield team members from ad-hoc work during their work-week or to ensure the platform runs smoothly 24/7. However, exposing Duty schedules is easy at the start, but once you have three schedules, it becomes unclear who is on duty. Hence, a small front-end usually solves this, but that require manual intervention when the schedule changes. This projects aims to solve that by automatically fetching who is on duty from iCalendars

## Ideas for additional features
- Implement announcement calendar.
- Implement extra plugin sync functionality, e.g. Workday integration.
